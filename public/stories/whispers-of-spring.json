      "title": "The Dream Garden",
      "content": "<p>The Dream Garden existed in the space between sleeping and waking, where thoughts took root and grew into impossible things. Every spring, for exactly one week, its gates opened to those who believed in magic more than logic.</p><p>Mei had found it by accident. At twelve, she had been struggling with her grandmother's death, unable to accept that someone so full of life could simply... stop existing. She had fallen asleep crying in her grandmother's abandoned greenhouse, surrounded by withered plants that no one had remembered to water.</p><p>When she woke, the greenhouse was transformed. Vines heavy with star-shaped flowers climbed the walls. Trees grew from seeds to full bloom in the space of a heartbeat. And everywhere, the air shimmered with the sound of whispers—not words exactly, but the feeling of being understood.</p><p>\"Welcome, dreamer,\" said a voice like wind through leaves. A woman stood before her, ageless and beautiful, with eyes that held the depth of forests. \"Your grandmother spoke of you often.\"</p><p>Mei's heart caught. \"You knew Baba?\"</p><p>\"She was the garden's keeper before you. Every generation, one child is chosen—one who sees not just what is, but what could be.\"</p>"

      "title": "Memories in Bloom",
      "content": "<p>The woman—who introduced herself as Luna, the garden's guardian—led Mei through paths that shifted with her thoughts. Here, memories became flowers: the dandelion that was her first day of school, the rose that was her parents' wedding, the tiny forget-me-nots that were every moment she had shared with her grandmother.</p><p>\"But they're dying,\" Mei whispered, touching a rose that was fading to gray. \"Everything dies.\"</p><p>Luna's smile was sad and wise. \"Not dying. Changing. In the Dream Garden, nothing truly ends—it transforms. Watch.\"</p><p>As the gray rose fell apart, it didn't crumble to dust. Instead, it became a cloud of silver butterflies, each carrying a fragment of memory. They swirled around Mei, and suddenly she was five years old again, sitting on her grandmother's lap as they planted tomato seeds together.</p><p>\"She's not gone,\" Luna said softly. \"She's just... distributed. Every act of kindness you do, every plant you nurture, every child you teach to believe in magic—that's her, living through you.\"</p>"

      "title": "The Inheritance",
      "content": "<p>Over the next six days, Mei learned the garden's secrets. How to plant dreams that would grow into reality. How to harvest memories that would sustain others through their own winters. How to speak the language of growing things, which was really the language of hope.</p><p>On the seventh day, Luna took her to the heart of the garden, where a single tree grew. Its branches held every dream the garden had ever nurtured, its roots reached into both the waking world and the realm of sleep.</p><p>\"This is your inheritance,\" Luna said. \"But also your responsibility. The garden needs a new keeper, someone who will tend it not just with water and sunlight, but with stories and love.\"</p><p>Mei placed her hand on the tree's trunk, and felt the garden's pulse—slow, steady, eternal. She understood then that her grandmother hadn't left her alone. She had simply passed on the most important gift: the knowledge that magic wasn't something you found in a garden.</p><p>It was something you grew.</p>"

      "content": "<p>As she woke in the greenhouse, the plants around her were green and thriving. On the workbench sat a single seed, glowing softly with its own inner light. Beside it, her grandmother's gardening gloves, worn and familiar.</p><p>Mei smiled, understanding at last. The Dream Garden wasn't a place you visited. It was a place you carried inside you, blooming with every act of love, every moment of wonder, every whispered hope that spring would always come again.</p>"
