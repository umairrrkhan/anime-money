And what we have is real.\"</p><p>Her declaration of love broke the curse, but it came with a price - Sakura would have to choose between her mortal life and joining Akira in the afterlife. In the end, they found a third option: Sakura would live out her mortal life, but their souls would remain connected across the veil between life and death.</p><p>\"Our love transcends even death itself,\" Akira whispered as they shared one final embrace before dawn.</p>"
